# Regression
In this repository i have created six colab file in which i have code for six regression model using two different dataset .
# Dataset used
1. salary data.csv 
consists of two column a) Years experience b) Salary 
2. Position slaraies
consists of three column a) position b) level c) salary
# Regression model used 
1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression

In this repository i have imported different libraries, then i read the dataset , then divide dataset into training and testing dataset , then i have applied model on the dataset to predict correct result, then i visualize the outcome.
# Libraries used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn
4. Matplotlib
# Introduction on different Regression model
1. Linear Regression: Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It's used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog).
2. Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple linear regression (MLR/multiple regression) is a statistical technique. It can use several variables to predict the outcome of a different variable. The goal of multiple regression is to model the linear relationship between your independent variables and your dependent variable.
3. Polynomial Regression: The goal of polynomial regression is to model a non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables (technically, between the independent variable and the conditional mean of the dependent variable).
4. Support Vector Regression: Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin). The Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification, with only a few minor differences.
5. Decision Regression: Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.
6. Random Regression : Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. ... A Random Forest operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees.
